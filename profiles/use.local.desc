dev-haskell/hadrian:test - Enables the hadrian selftest rules which require QuickCheck. Disabling it thus saves on a few dependencies which can be problematic when bootstrapping.
dev-haskell/hadrian:threaded - Build with the threaded runtime for improved performance. Users with bootstrap compilers which don't support the threaded runtime should disable this flag.
